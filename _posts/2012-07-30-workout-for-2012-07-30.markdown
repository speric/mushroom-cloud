Did FLR on the rings, because why not? Broken it up...took around 10 minutes.  Sucked.  Could have done a few reps more on the tabatas but I wanted to situate myself.  Hadn't done tabata in a while so wasn't sure what I had in the tank, but I felt good.  Two hours later, sore!

10 minute recovery walk @ easy pace after lunch.
